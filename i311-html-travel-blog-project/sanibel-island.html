							<h1>Overview</h1>
							<p>Sanibel Island is one of my most favorite frequented destinations due to its vibrant
								range of colors, local identity, and generally nice weather year-round. Nearly all the
								shops, ranging from ice cream to art to dining, are locally operated and provide a
								pleasant escape from the various chains that are sometimes too ubiquitous in many other
								areas.
							</p>
							<p>While this destination can be quite expensive to stay at, the experiences are certainly
								worthwhile, and there tends to be enough flexibility in terms of rooming options to
								lower the cost of one's stay if planned in advance. Overall, for anyone looking for an
								alternative to other destinations like the Bahamas or even other localities in Florida,
								I would highly recommend Sanibel Island for your next stay!</p>

						<p>Sanibel Island has a wide range of biodiversity due to the vastly untouched parts of the
							island for conservation. After taking a guided fishing trip to various locations around
							Sanibel Island, such as the pier, areas adjacent to the Causeway, and popular ecosystems
							outside of Captiva (north of Sanibel Island), we were able to ecstatically catch a few
							sharks and even see dolphins cruising behind ships!</p>
						<p>On the boat dock as visualized, several pelicans would boisterously crowd around those who
							returned with fish, which was peculiar yet very amusing to see. Even for those not watching
							to fish, Sanibel Island offers several excursions similar like kayaking, where our group was
							able to paddle by multiple manatees floating near the surface!</p>

						<p>Beyond this, Sanibel Island's natural beauty ensures a sense of familiarity yet diversity for
							every
							subsequent visit, regardless of the part of the island experienced. For instance, shells are
							naturally clustered due to the large amount of the coast facing south, thereby causing daily
							rain and other events to push the shells with perfect ubiquity across the coast. The sand is
							also a very soft and granular material, and you'd be hard to not find runners every morning
							due to the perfect length of the coast for a nice morning run. Overall, spending time at the
							beach always feels rejuvenating and manageable to due to the aforementioned smaller size of
							the coast.</p>
						<p>In terms of dining, Sanibel Island, as noted, mostly contains locally operated restaurants,
							which tends to incentivize more variety and higher quality meals for tourists. Nearly every
							food, ranging from pizza to seafood to breakfast, all encompass Sanibel Island's selections
							and certainly my own personal recommendations from my visits. This emphasis on locality
							makes Sanibel Island one of the most destinations in the world in this regard!</p>

				<h1>Tips</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Below, I've included a few potentially good-to-know tips that can assist you with familiarizing
						with Sanibel Island and a few of its intracacies:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Whenever you want to travel across the Causeway into Sanibel Island, you'll have to pay a
							subsidiary toll fee that can quickly add up if not considered. Buying groceries is cheaper
							off the island, but I would recommend stocking up half or least all of the groceries you'll
							need at chains like Publix or Walmart before making another trip.</li>
						<li>You can find dolphins and manatees swimming quite close to the shores at times; I had more
							success when finding places near the lighhouse, and time of day isn't much of a factor
							unless there's a considerable amount of tourists residing further out in the water.</li>
						<li>Restaurants become increasingly packed from 6-8pm, regardless of the day of the week. Early
							dinners may be advised so that you avoid these crowds, receive more early-bird specials, and
							have opportunities to do other time-sensitive activities that may otherwise be closed later
							on during these meal times.</li>
						<li>The southeastern part of the island tends to offer cheaper hotel prices than the west side
							due to its proximity to Captiva. Many houses also rent out through local vacation rental
							services, which can offer one month housing stay prices comparable to much shorter one week
							cruises.</li>
