# team-04 - AptiStudy - Study Group Finder and Management

<h2>Application Overview and Importance</h2>

<p>AptiStudy serves as a two-pronged web-based application for IU students who either may be struggling within a course and wish to find study group friends.</p>
<p>By coalescing the academic and social aspects of college through the application of study groups, individuals can better meet their course expectations, establish relationships with others directly within their courses, and more effectively manage academic/study groups without the unnecessary stress due to lack of coordination within groups.</p>
<p>While we have placed an emphasis on study groups, AptiStudy is still pervasive for all types of groups and offers flexibility based on various student needs. By focusing on IU students, our application can provide the best and flexible functionalities tailored to their individual needs for group finding and management.</p>

<h2>A Few Functionalities</h2>
<p>Below outlines a few general functionalities and their usages within the Aptistudy application:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Compatibility Questionnaire</b> - This questionnaire helps students match within courses based on a set of parameters regarding study/academic needs. Thus, students within courses who potentially had never conversed in class can expand their social network through this functionality.</li>
  <li><b>Study Group Management</b> - Here, students will simply be able to create and host study groups, set member limitations as well as group goals, leave groups if desired, and delete groups as hosts.</li>
  <li><b>Meeting Management</b> - Within groups, members can specify meetings, including a set of parameters like meeting times, locations, descriptions, etc. Members can also join already-created meetings if a slot is available.</li>
  <li><b>Room Booking</b> - If groups wish to meet within classrooms on campus, they can additionally specify these based on availabilities and use a map API to identify where buildings are located on campus.</li>
  <li><b>Group Calendars</b> - Here, students can navigate their group calendars and add, delete, edit, and view notifications pertaining to each individual group.</li>
</ul>
