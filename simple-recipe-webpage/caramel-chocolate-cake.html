            <p>To render the most comprehensive recipe due to the varying baking, assemblage methods,
                and ingredient accompaniments, I utilize a combination of two recipes throughout the
                baking process. In the first recipe,

                    Camila on the site <em>pies &amp; tacos</em></a>
                primarily highlights the glazing process and includes rationale for many of the
                instructions when baking the cake; in the second recipe, the
                <!-- Recipe 2 Source Attribution: https://basilandbuttercream.com/chocolate-salted-caramel-pretzel-cake/ | Recipe by admin on basil & Buttercream -->
                <a href="https://basilandbuttercream.com/chocolate-salted-caramel-pretzel-cake/" target="_blank">
                    <em>basil &amp; Buttercream team</em></a>
                sectionalizes the cake into different recipes and offers additional instructions
                for chocolate ganache if desired.
            </p>

            <!-- Typography change for apostrophe -->
            <p>
                While the caramel sauce applied throughout can be store-bought, both recipes simplify
                the cooking process for making delicious homemade servings. Therefore, the ingredients
                and instructions both account for this, but store-bought caramel sauce still works perfectly
                when added to the cake during glazing. The majority of the subsequent sections will
                reference Camila&rsquo;s recipe, yet any recipes and directions for chocolate ganache will
                be in reference to the basil & Buttercream team&rsquo;s recipe.

                We want to bake the chocolate cake at 350&#8457; since any other temperature may
                reduce rigidness needed to support the Fudge Truffles on top or potentially burn the
                cake. Moveover, if any sugar is still crystallized in the salted caramel sauce, we need
                to attempt to mix the sauce well while maintaining viscosity or pour the sauce through a filter
                to catch this residing sugar. Lastly, boiling for the chocolate ganache indicates any
                bubbling on the surface of the cream.

                    <li>First make sure the Salted Caramel Sauce is completely cool down, but not cold from the fridge.
                        If the sauce is warm, it will melt the butter from the frosting, and if it&rsquo;s cold it will

                        up</li>
                    <li>It has to be at room temperature</li>
                    <li>Sift the powdered sugar and set it aside</li>
                    <li>Cream the butter at medium high speed for 3 minutes, until very fluffy</li>
                    <li>Add the sifted powdered sugar to the butter and mix on low to combine</li>
                    <li>Add the caramel and raise the speed to medium high, and cream for a couple of minutes, until
                        fluffy</li>
                    <li>Add the salt and the vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>If the buttercream is too runny, add more sifted powdered sugar to adjust the consistency. And
                        if the buttercream is too stiff, add a teaspoon or so of water or milk to thin it out</li>

                    <li>Place one cake layer on top of a cake plate</li>
                    <!-- Typography change for apostrophe -->
                    <li>Transfer some of the buttercream to a piping bag, leaving the remaining buttercream covered so
                        it doesn&rsquo;t dry up</li>
                    <li>Spread a very thin layer of buttercream on top of the first cake layer. This will help the
                        caramel sauce not soak into the cake</li>
                    <li>Pipe a ring of frosting around the edges of the first layer</li>
                    <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of caramel sauce in the middle of the cake</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of buttercream on the bottom of the next cake layer</li>
                    <li>Place it on top of the caramel filled cake layer</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of buttercream on the cake. Then pipe a ring of frosting around, and fill
                        with caramel sauce</li>
                    <li>Repeat until you reach the final cake layer, remembering to always spread a layer of buttercream
                        on both sides of the cakes, to prevent the caramel sauce from soaking into the cake</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of frosting around the whole cake and smooth it out</li>
                    <li>Place the cake in the fridge and let the cake cool for about 30 minutes</li>
                    <li>This process is called crumb coating, and it helps to seal the crumbs of cake in, so they
                        don&rsquo;t
                        show on the final layer of frosting</li>
                    <li>Remove the cake from the fridge and apply a thick coating of frosting around the cake. Use a
                        spatula to smooth it out as best as possible</li>
                    <li>Place the cake back in the fridge until very cold, for at least 1 hour</li>
                    <li>Then you can begin to drip the caramel down the sides of the cake</li>
                    <li>I placed the caramel in a piping bag. You can place the caramel in a piping bag, or use a spoon,
                        or simply pour the sauce on top of the cake</li>
                    <li>I usually test out a couple of drops of caramel on the back of the cake to see if they are
                        dripping nicely and steadily before pouring the caramel drip on the whole cake</li>
                    <li>If the caramel is too runny, I&rsquo;ll place it in the fridge for 5 minutes or so. And if the
                        caramel
                        is too thick, I will microwave it for 3 to 5 seconds to thin it out slightly</li>
                    <li>Place the cake back in the fridge for about 2 hours to let the caramel drip dry before piping
                        anything on top of the cake</li>
                </ol>

                    <!-- Typography change for apostrophe -->
                    <p><strong>Coffee in the cake</strong>: Always feel free to substitute the hot coffee for hot water.
                        You
                        could also add 1 teaspoon of espresso powder to the dry ingredients if that&rsquo;s the case, or
                        simply go
                        without and use just the hot water. I have made this cake many times without coffee, using water
                        instead, and it turned out fine. The coffee is simply used to enhance the chocolate flavor and
                        richness, but not completely mandatory.</p>

                    <p><strong>Caramel</strong>: If using store-bought caramel sauce, you will need 2 to 2 1/2 cups of
                        caramel for the filling, for the frosting, and for the caramel drip.</p>

                    <p><strong>Salt</strong>: Leave out the salt from the recipe for regular caramel, or increase the
                        amount
                        of salt if you like it really salted. Cinnamon: a little sprinkle of cinnamon in the frosting
                        (about
                        1/4 tsp) will go a long way here and really add a lot of depth to the flavors of this cake.</p>

                    <p><strong>Truffles</strong>: I topped the cake with these Caramel Fudge Truffles. They are super
                        easy
                        to make.</p>
